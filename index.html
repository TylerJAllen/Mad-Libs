        <p>
          It was National <span class="noun1"></span> Day and <span class="male1"></span> was running an hour late. He was supposed to meet his girlfriend, <span class="female1"></span>, at <span class="person1"></span>'s Famous <span class="animal1"></span> Slaughterhouse of Deliciousness. While speeding through traffic, he received a text from his girlfriend that read: "<em><span class="message2"></span></em>". <span class="male1"></span> knew he had to flex his charm to dig out of this hole, so he typed "<em><span class="message1"></span></em>" into his phone and pressed 'send' with a confident smirk on his face. Just a few seconds later, he received the following text: "<em>Oh, baby, I'm so sorry for being mad at you! That was the sweetest thing you have ever said to me! I love you more than canned <span class="food1"></span> and want to live happily ever after with you!</em>" But she didn't get the chance to live happily ever after with <span class="male1"></span> because he died in a horrific car crash while reading her text.<br>
          Arrive alive, don't text and drive.
